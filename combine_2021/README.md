## Modelling and analysis with COPASI using python scripting
During this tutorial, attendees will learn basic techniques for modeling and simulation of biochemical networks using the [BasiCO](https://basico.readthedocs.io/). We’ll see how to create models or use models in SBML format, simulate them, and set up parameter estimation tasks. The hands-on exercises throughout the course will ensure that attendees become familiar with the software tools and with analyzing, creating, editing, importing, and simulating biochemical networks.

**Given the current situation, the workshop will be held as a virtual meeting (online course). We will send around a conference link.**

Prerequisites: Some knowledge of mathematical modeling will be advantageous as well as some basic knowledge of the python language.
