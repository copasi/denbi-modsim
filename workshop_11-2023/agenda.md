### Requirements

Please install/download the software tools and additional material prior to the workshop:

#### CellNetAnalyzer

- CellNetAnalyzer download: For the practical exercises on Day 1 you can download CNA from the following website.
<https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/download.html>

- For installation of CNApy follow the instructions on: <https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy>.


- MATLAB: For the practical exercises with CNA you need MATLAB.
If you do not have access to MATLAB you may download a
30 day trial version here:
<https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html>


#### COPASI

For the hands on session with COPASI on the second day you may download COPASI from: <http://copasi.org/Download/>


 * for the modelling session, you will be asked to download 
   [BioModel #64](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000064), for your convenience it is also available [here](BIOMD0000000064_url.xml). 
 * For the parameter estimation part, we have this [archive](2023-11-28_-_Copasi_PE.zip), containing some models and data files to use during the tutorial.
 * To wrap things up we demonstrate how to use COPASI from a python
   Scripting interface. Here is the shared 
   [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ucqF-WiZK6S8khGU90Zp1tXLTUFqc50U?usp=sharing), you 
   can access it without Google account, however it will only allow 
   you to make changes if you are logged in. All changes I make will 
   be displayed there. 

* Slides: 
  * [Intro Modelling](denbi_sysbio_block1-4.pdf) 
  * [Parameter Estimation](2023-11-27_-_ParameterEstimation.pdf)
  
 

#### SABIO-RK
For the SABIO-RK hands-on session on the third day you will need Python and the Python library Requests: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests>

For the SEEK API hands-on session you should either install [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) or be allowed to use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Jupyter hosted by Google).
