## Tools for systems biology modeling and data exchange
During this 3-day course, attendees will learn basic techniques for modeling of biochemical networks including data access and storage due to the FAIR principles. The hands on exercises throughout the three days will ensure that attendees become familiar with the software tools and with analyzing, creating, editing, importing, simulating and storing biochemical networks. The first day SABIO-RK is used as a resource for kinetic data and FAIRDOM Hub/SEEK is introduced as a data and model management platform fitted to the needs of systems biologists. The second day introduces principles of stoichiometric and constraint-based modeling coupled with hands on exercises using CellNetAnalyzer. The third day continues with kinetic modeling techniques which will be illustrated and exercised with COPASI. 

### NEWS

> We all have been following the COVID-19 pandemic these past weeks and months. 
For the longest time we hoped, that we would have been able to hold the workshop on "Tools for systems biology modeling and data exchange", in Magdeburg on 27th-29th April 2020. 

> However, it has become apparent, that it won't be possible to carry out the workshop. 
And so, we unfortunately must cancel the workshop at this time. 

> Due to the focus on hands on exercises, we don't feel that an online presentation would be adequate.  

> However, the organizers plan on holding the workshop later this year, we will inform you as soon as we have fixed a new date.

### Parameter Estimation
For the parameter estimation part, we have this [archive](2018-04-23_-_COPASI_PE.zip), containing some models and data files to use during the tutorial. [Second dataset](test_modelselection.txt) for model selection of basic model.
